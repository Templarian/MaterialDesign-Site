# Contribute

Material Design Icons is only around because of the [team of contributors](/contributors).

## Ways to Help

### Suggest Icons

The easiest way to help is to suggest icons, all you need is a GitHub account.

Simply visit the [issues](https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign/issues) section of our repository and click "New issue", a template should be there already so you know what information we're looking for. You should include what icon you're looking for (obviosuly) and if possible a few examples.

The team will take a look at your issue as soon as possible and label it accordingly. We may ask you for more information on what exactly you want or even reject your suggestion entirely if we feel it's too specific, but don't let that put you off suggesting more icons in the future!

A member of the team or another designer should eventually reply with a designed icon, then we will review it and hopefully add it to the set.

### Contribute Icons

You may want to contribue an icon that you made yourself, that's great! Just create an [issue](https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign/issues) on GitHub and we'll take a look. Make sure you follow the [Material Design guidelines](https://material.io/guidelines/style/icons.html#icons-system-icons) so you will have to make little to no revisions and hopefully it'll get added to the set!

If you need ideas for what to design you can always take a look at the currently open issues and reply with your design.

It's surprising how many different ways an icon can be conveyed. While the guidelines give good structure, having a diverse set of choices allows for continuous refinment on new and existing icons. If you want to you can open an issue with a refined design or even lowered point count.

Once **five** of your icons have been added to the set you can become a contributor! What does this mean? Well, you get a contributor account on the site which allows you to manage icons and also have all the icons you designed assigned under your name.

### Develop

This [site](/contribute/site) is open source, from the documentation to the front end. Any modification in the `master` branch builds within 30 seconds to production and pull requests are usually merged very quickly (especially documentation).

The tech stack consists of relatively modern tooling, but is organized to be easy to edit for newcomers:

- Angular 6
- Bootstrap 4 (SASS)
- Content is mostly Markdown files and can be edited right from GitHub's editor.

The [API endpoints](/contribute/site/api) are still being documented and are being worked on to provide more robust functionality.
